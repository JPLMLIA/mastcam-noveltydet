# How to Deploy Jupyter Lab

Edit the `.env` file to specify the location of the code, data, and the password for Jupyter Lab. 
The default password is `asdf` and a new password can be generated by running `generate_token.py` and pasting the output into your `.env` file.

From the base directory, use `docker-compose build`. This uses the `docker-compose.yml` file to create a container 
as specified in the `novelty_docker/` directory. The `Dockerfile` specifies to use the [Jupyter Docker Image](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks), copy `requirements.txt` to our container, and use `pip` to install the required libraries. 

Once the container is built, it can be run using `docker-compose up`. 
This will start an instance of Jupyter Lab at `localhost:8888` with your password.
Your working and data directories are mounted in the container and changes done in either Jupyter Lab or on your local machine will be synced.
